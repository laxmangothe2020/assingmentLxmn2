             Hello, my name is Laxman Gothe. Currently, I am a student of Software Engineering Technology in the 3rd semester. I am from Nepal. I believe that learning never ends. I love hiking, rafting, and traveling to new places in my free time.<br><br>
             Regarding to my education, I had completed a bachlor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering fro Tribhuvan University, Nepal.<br><br>
             I had enrolled in Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College to a software developer and currently I am enrolled in 3rd semester. Software technology is my first subject that I am taking in Canada and I am enjoying it as it is my part of interest too.<br><br>
             Thank You<br>
             With Regards<br>
             Laxman Gothe<br>
